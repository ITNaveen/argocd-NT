This way argocd metrics can be scraped via prometheus.

# Let me refine that understanding to make it even clearer:

ArgoCD Services: There are four main ArgoCD services running in your Kubernetes cluster:
1. argocd-repo-server
2. argocd-metrics
3. argocd-applicationset-controller
4. argocd-server-metrics

# Service Monitors: 
Each of these ArgoCD services has a corresponding ServiceMonitor resource. These ServiceMonitors are Kubernetes custom resources (from the Prometheus Operator) that act like connectors. They tell Prometheus: "Here's a service, here's which port to look at, and here's how to collect metrics from it."

# Data Flow: 
The metrics data flows from your ArgoCD services to Prometheus. The ServiceMonitors don't collect the data themselves; they just provide the configuration that tells Prometheus where and how to collect it.

# Prometheus Rules: 
Once Prometheus has this data, it evaluates it against PrometheusRules. These rules contain expressions like "if metric X is above threshold Y for Z minutes, then trigger an alert." This is how you detect problems in your ArgoCD installation.

# AlertManager: 
When rules are triggered, AlertManager handles the notification process – sending messages to your team through whatever channels you've configured.

# Grafana: 
Finally, Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source and displays the metrics in dashboards. This gives you a visual way to monitor the health and performance of your ArgoCD services.

# The entire system creates an automated monitoring pipeline:
ArgoCD Services → ServiceMonitors → Prometheus → PrometheusRules → AlertManager for alerts
And Prometheus → Grafana for visualization.

This setup means you don't have to manually check if ArgoCD is working correctly. The monitoring system constantly watches it for you and alerts you only when there's something that needs your attention.

# argocd-server-metrics vs argocd-metrics - 

1. argocd-metrics
This service collects general operational metrics about the overall ArgoCD system. It includes:

Application health statistics (how many apps are healthy, degraded, or failed).
Synchronization statistics (success rates, failure counts, and durations).
Repository statistics (connection status, refresh times).
Controller processing metrics (how efficiently the controllers are handling workloads).
Resource reconciliation metrics (how often and how quickly ArgoCD is reconciling desired state with actual state).
General system metrics like memory usage, goroutine counts, and API request handling statistics.

Think of argocd-metrics as giving you the "big picture" health of your entire ArgoCD installation. It's like monitoring the vital signs of the complete system.

2. argocd-server-metrics
This service is more focused on the ArgoCD API server specifically. It collects:

API server request metrics (latency, error rates, request counts by endpoint).
User session information (active sessions, session durations).
Authentication metrics (login success/failure rates).
RBAC metrics (authorization checks, access request patterns).
gRPC service metrics for the ArgoCD API.
UI/API server performance indicators.
Connection pool statistics for database connections.
Web socket connection metrics.

Think of argocd-server-metrics as focusing specifically on the "front door" of ArgoCD - the server component that handles user interactions, UI requests, and API calls.

- The distinction is important because when troubleshooting, you might need to look at different metrics depending on the issue:
If users are complaining about slow UI or failed logins, you'd look at argocd-server-metrics.
If applications aren't synchronizing properly or you're seeing system-wide issues, you'd focus on argocd-metrics.

Together, these two metrics services provide comprehensive visibility into both the user-facing components and the internal workings of your ArgoCD installation.

##### ##### ####### ######### ###########
###### ------------ DEMO ---------#######

1. argocd get svc (we can see "argocd-metrics").
2. pick its IP and then curl IP:port/metrics , we can see it generated alot of prom metrics.
3. in order to visualize this, we need prom server.
   - we can use helm chart called - "kube-prometheus-stack" (https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack).
   - click on install option then we get a window to add repo and install chart.
   - create monitoring ns first then install this chart.
   - release name is - my-kube-prometheus-stack.
   - kubectl get all -n monitoring.
4. now pick svc in monitoring ns , named with - my-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus (make it nodeport).
5. open this in UI and see status and targets, so these are targets prometheus is listening on.
6. we dont have argocd as a target here, so we got to do this.
8. In this - https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/metrics/#prometheus-operator. we have all argocd services tyo fetch data from.
   we do need to change "metadata.labels.release" name and in our case its "kube-prometheus-stack".
9. copy this yaml with modified release name and use all 4 services and then create a yaml in k8s (argocd-svc-monitor.yaml).
10. apply this in argocd ns, now promethus will scrap data from these 4 services.
11. since pro.. can see these svc and fetch data then we can check if its working fine. so pick metrics like "aargocd_app_info" from 
    "https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/metrics/#prometheus-operator" check in prome... dashboard.
12. for grafana check "argocd grafana dashboaard" and copy the URL you get (id is very important here). 
    this - "https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14584-argocd/".
13. in monitoring ns we have grafana svc as well, make it NodePort.
14. grafana is open and username is admin, password from secret. 
    - kubectl get secrets -n monitoring and pick grafan secret.
    - kubectl get secrets my-kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring -o json.
    - decode password with base 64 and then use it.
15. click on + mark then import - paste this URL - https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14584-argocd/. 
16. now i have all argocd metrics in grafana.
