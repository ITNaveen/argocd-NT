- ArgoCD is a GitOps tool that ensures Kubernetes applications are deployed as defined in Git. It tracks the Target State (desired state from Git) and compares it with the Live State (actual state in Kubernetes). If they don't match, it can Sync the changes to make them consistent. It also provides Sync Status to check if everything is up to date, and Health checks to ensure the application is running properly.

# Synchronization (Syncing Git with Kubernetes)
Sync Status → Checks whether the live state (what's running) matches the target state (what's in Git).
Example: If they match, everything is fine. If they don’t, something is outdated or wrong.

Sync → The process of making the live state match the target state.
Example: Applying updates from Git to Kubernetes.

Sync Operation Status → Whether the sync was successful or not.
Example: If a deployment fails due to an error, the sync status will show failure.

# Target State → This is what your application should be, as defined in Git. It includes:

Kubernetes manifest files (YAML files)
Helm charts
Kustomize configurations, etc.
Live State → This is what your application actually is in the Kubernetes cluster right now. It includes:

The number of running pods
ConfigMaps, secrets, etc., that are currently deployed
Any differences from the target state
Example:
Your Git repo has a deployment.yaml file that defines 3 replicas for a pod.
But in Kubernetes, only 2 pods are running due to an issue.
ArgoCD detects a mismatch (Sync Status = Out of Sync).
You trigger a Sync to apply the missing pod and bring the live state back to the target state.

# further explanation - 
1. Out of Sync: This happens when there’s a mismatch between the desired state (from the Git repository) and the actual state in the Kubernetes cluster. If you're using manual sync, you will see the application as Out of Sync when changes occur that don't match the Git repository (like having 2 replicas running instead of 3). You'd then have to manually trigger a sync to bring the state back in sync.

2. Automatic Sync: If you have auto-sync enabled in ArgoCD, ArgoCD will automatically apply the changes in the Git repository to the cluster. So, if there is a discrepancy, ArgoCD will automatically fix it by adjusting the number of replicas (or making other necessary changes). In this case, you won't see "Out of Sync" because ArgoCD will immediately reconcile the desired and actual states, bringing everything back to alignment without manual intervention.

Application = Your deployment files (YAML manifests or Helm charts) in Git.
Application Source Type = The method used to package/deploy (Helm, Kustomize, or raw Kubernetes YAML).

# app vs project - 
In ArgoCD, each microservice (e.g., auth-service, payment-service, order-service) is treated as an Application. The overall system or product (e.g., E-commerce Platform) is structured as a Project that groups these applications together.
Example Structure in ArgoCD:
```yaml
    Project: Ecommerce-Project
        Application: auth-service (manages authentication)
        Application: payment-service (handles transactions)
        Application: order-service (manages orders)
        Application: frontend (user interface)

To Summarize:
    webservice_tik = ArgoCD Project (this is the overall app that groups everything)
    frontend-app = ArgoCD Application (for the frontend, which may contain 10 microservices)
    backend-app = ArgoCD Application (for the backend, which may contain multiple microservices)
    db-app = ArgoCD Application (for the database)
```
