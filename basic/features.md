1. ArgoCD can deploy applications to specific targets in multiple clusters, which makes it a powerful tool for managing deployments across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) or even multiple Kubernetes clusters.

2. it provide audit trails for api calls and event.

3. sso integration.

4. webhook integration based on github or bitbuket.

5. rollback any app config within git repo.
   in a GitOps-based deployment (e.g., using ArgoCD), rolling back an application configuration is as simple as reverting to a previous Git commit. Since deployments are driven by Git, rolling back = restoring a previous known good state in Git.

6. web ui for real time view of activity.

7. it can detect drift and provide visualization to pin point differences.

8. out of the box prometheus set up.

9. it has pre sync and post sync hooks to support complex rollout like canery, blue-green.

10. multi-tenency and RBAC based authorization. 
    RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Ensuring users/teams have the right level of access to specific resources.

    ✔ Multi-tenancy enables different teams, apps, or customers to share the same Kubernetes cluster securely.
    ✔ Namespaces, RBAC, Network Policies, and Resource Quotas are key for isolation.
    ✔ ArgoCD RBAC ensures tenants can only deploy/manage their own apps.
    ✔ Choose between soft (namespace-based) or hard (cluster-based) multi-tenancy depending on security needs.

11. automatation can be done by CLI as well.

12. health analysis is there and we can have out own health checks as well.
ArgoCD automatically evaluates the health of deployed resources and assigns them a health status based on Kubernetes conditions.

Common Health States in ArgoCD:
Health Status	            Description
Healthy                 	The resource is running and functioning as expected.
Progressing	                The resource is still being created or updated.
Degraded	                The resource has an issue (e.g., pod crash, failed deployment).
Suspended	                The resource has been paused.
Unknown	                    ArgoCD cannot determine the health of the resource.

13. provides option to automaically or manually to sync to desired state.
